Sprint 1:
1.VPC and enable DNS resolution and DNS hostname -> done
2. Internet Gateway and attach to VPC -> done
3. create Public subnet in AZ1 and AZ2(10.0.0.0/24,10.0.1.0/24) and enable auto-assign public IPV4 -> done
4. Create public route table, add IG as route and associate 2 public subnet -> done
5. create 4 private subnets for app and data in AZ1 and AZ2 (
    APP AZ1->10.0.2.0/24,
    APP AZ2->10.0.3.0/24,
    Data AZ1-> 10.0.4.0/24,
    Data AZ2->10.0.5.0/24
    )
6. Create NAT Gateway (
    NAT Gateway AZ1 -> public subnet Az1 -> connectivity typw = public , allocate ellastic Ip
    NAT Gateway AZ2 -> public subnet Az2 -> connectivity typw = public , allocate ellastic Ip
)
7. Create Private Route table(
    private route table AZ1-> add Nat Gateway AZ1 as route and associte private APP AZ1 and Private Data AZ1 subnet
    private route table AZ2-> add Nat Gateway AZ2 as route and associte private APP AZ2 and Private Data AZ2 subnet
)
8. Security Groups (
    1.ALB SG {allow HTTP(80) and HTTPS(443)}
    2.SSH SG {allow SSH (22)}
    3.webserver SG { http and https->ALB SG, ssh ->SSH SG}
    4.Database SG{MYSQL/Aurora port 3306 -> webserver SG}
)
